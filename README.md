Credit Card Churn Prediction
Credit Card Customer Data with features such as Age, Gender, Credit Limit and so on is used by Machine Learning and Deep Learning to classify each credit card customer as one who retains the use of their credit card or does not. That way one is able to predict the attrition rate among current credit card customers. This is a supervised or labeled classification problem. The results shall appear shortly on Github.
